Data been through many tasks before Clustring and data reduction :
That included preparing data
- Data Claening 
- Distribution of Features
- Identfiying missing values in  dataset
- Handlled mising data 
- visualaisation
- converted categorical and ordinal features into numeric features
- Created dummy features
- Transformed a categorical feature into a set of dummy features, each representing a unique category
- Transformed a categorical feature into a numeric values
- scaling , and Normalisation 

This document for :
- Corrleation (scaled and nonscaled )
- Clustering of both data (scaled and nonscaled )
    - Drop highly correlated features
- PCA both (scaled and nonscaled ) Feature Extraction 
- k-fold  , Elbow method to select optimal K
- Checking optimal number of Clusters
